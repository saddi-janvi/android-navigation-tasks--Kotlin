## Table of Contents

1. [Front-page Activity](#front-page-activity)
2. [Movie Fragment](#movie-fragment)
3. [ViewPager2 Activity](#viewpager2-activity)
4. [Master/Detail Flow](#masterdetail-flow)

## Front-page Activity

### Description

The front-page activity introduces a new navigation scheme using buttons. It loads a front-page fragment containing buttons for "About Me," "Task 2," and "Task 3." Clicking on these buttons navigates to the corresponding activities or fragments.

## Movie Fragment

### Description

Implemented a fragment to display detailed information about a movie. The fragment includes fields such as Title, Description, Image, Year, Stars, and Rating. The layout is designed to be visually appealing and will be reused in subsequent tasks.

## ViewPager2 Activity

### Description

Implemented a ViewPager2 activity where each page displays details of a movie. Users can swipe left or right to navigate between movies. A tab layout is incorporated, with each tab representing a movie. Clicking on a tab displays the corresponding movie details.

## Master/Detail Flow

### Description

Implemented an activity that initially loads a fragment with three buttons, each corresponding to a different movie. On phones with a small screen, clicking a button loads the movie details fragment, replacing the Movie_List fragment. On tablets with a large screen, both the Movie_List fragment and the detail fragment are displayed side by side.
